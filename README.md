put numbbers in an array so it can display it as you type


add the numbers to an array to display

when an operation is hit , takes the numbers in array, join them together, and parse them as a double, check if it has a negative sign in front if it does, remove it from the array, parse it and then multiply it by negative 1

when the opeeration is hit it stores that operator in a string, it checks first if it is empty, if it is not empty, it takes the amount that was already parsed, parses the array that just was typed then and calls the function on that, displays that number. then it stores that number and emptys out the other array list
